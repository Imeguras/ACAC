No not the Finance Derivate, Simple PID Ackerman Controll

It works by aiming then throtling/braking.  Both controls are operated with separate PID controllers

#### Note:

The launch file has a parameter file hardcoded this is a major issue with this package but i figured someone else should have some knowledge about it

## Setup ["native"]

The package requires diagnostic-updater, geographic_info, ackermann_msg, and angles package as such you will have to do a rosdep install

## Setup [Arch based]

```bash
paru -S ros2-humble-ackermann-msgs
```
